        <p> The 3 main design elements shown in my 3D model are: Shape, Colour and Texture. I chose shape as I wanted use a few objects however add lots of detail to them, this made my object look significantly better as the detail to the stalk and orange skin looks a lot better than before. I chose colour as one of my design elements since my object is an orange and I obviously didn't want it to be green. The finial design element which was Texture was very relevant to my object as my object itself does not have a lot of detail however the texturing and sculting has alot of texture and is very eaily shown.  </p>
